1. To use subversion with emacs, first put

export EDITOR=emacs

in your ~/.bash_profile file.

2. Then use a command like one of the following:

git clone ssh://cascade.math.ualberta.ca/git/tri
git clone git@github.com:vectorgraphics/asymptote
git clone https://github.com/dealias/fftwpp fftw++

to make a new working directory for the project in the current directory.

The most useful git commands are

git fetch        (updates your local repo from remote repo)
git merge	 (merges updates in your local repo into your working directory)
git pull         (equivalent to git fetch followed by git merge)
git add file     (queue new file to add to local repo)
git commit -a    (commits changes to local repo)
git push         (updates remote repo with changes in local repo)
git diff         (identifies changes in your local directory)
git status       (describes current state)


git remote -v    (show remote url)
