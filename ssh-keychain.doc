Here are instructions for how to use keychain to initiate passwordless
openssh connections. Be sure that ssh agent forwarding is enabled for all
outgoing connections (check the setting in ssh_config or specify ssh -A).

These instructions are for SSH Protocol 2 (which is more secure than the
older Protocol 1).

1. Run the command on your local computer:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

Do not use blank pass phrases.

2. Type the commands:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

3. Download and install keychain from 

http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain.xml

4. Put in ~/.bashrc and relogin again

keychain -q ~/.ssh/id_rsa
. ~/.keychain/`uname -n`-sh

Or put in ~/.cshrc and relogin again

if($tty != "") then
keychain -q ~/.ssh/id_rsa
source ~/.keychain/`uname -n`-csh
endif

5. For each remote host REMOTE

ssh REMOTE mkdir -p -m 0755 \~/.ssh
scp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys REMOTE:.ssh/
