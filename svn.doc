1. To use subversion with emacs, first put

setenv EDITOR emacs

in your ~/.cshrc (if you are using tcsh) and
source ~/.cshrc

2. Then use a command like one of the following:

svn co https://asymptote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/asymptote/trunk/asymptote
svn co https://fftwpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fftwpp/trunk/fftw++
svn co svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/doc/trunk doc

to make a new working directory (e.g. asymptote or doc) in the current
directory.

The most useful commands are

svn update	 (updates your directory with the most recent version)
svn commit	 (executes above add command and commits local changes)
svn add file     (queue new file to add to repository)
svn diff         (identifies changes in your local directory)
svn diff -r HEAD (identifies differences between your directory and repository)
svn revert file	 (revert to repository version of file)

3. To recover an old svn snapshot of the asymptote directory do

mkdir old
cd old
svn co https://asymptote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/asymptote/trunk/asymptote
cd asymptote
svn update -r "{2006-05-21 23:55}"
OR
svn update -r "{2006-05-21}"
OR
svn update -r 1234

For further examples of revision specifications, see:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.tour.revs.html#svn.tour.revs.keywords

4. These commands are useful for examining revision history:

svn log
svn annotate file.cc
svn diff -r 1000:1001
svn diff -r "{2006-05-16 19:11}":"{2005-05-21 19:13}" 

Say man svn for more info.

In emacs:
M-x vc-annotate

5. Branch:

svn copy svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/dns/trunk svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/dns/simple

Merge:

svn copy svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/dns/trunk t4

Merge a branch back into the trunk (assuming that you have a working copy of the trunk, and that the branch was created in revision 250):

svn merge -r874:HEAD svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/dns/trunk

If you branched at revision 23, and you want to merge changes on trunk into your branch, you could do this from inside the working copy of your branch:

svn merge -r 23:HEAD svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/dns/trunk

6. Symbolic links can point to a local mirror of an external directory:

svn propset svn:externals "tex svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/tex" .
or
svn propedit svn:externals .
svn propget svn:externals .

7. To copy in a file or directory and its history from another working
directory DIR:
svn copy -r665 DIR .
