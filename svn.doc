1. To use subversion with emacs, first put

setenv EDITOR emacs

in your ~/.cshrc (if you are using tcsh) and
source ~/.cshrc

2. Then use a command like

svn co https://asymptote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/asymptote/trunk/asymptote

svn co svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/doc/trunk doc

to make a new working directory (e.g. asymptote or doc) in the current
directory.

The most useful commands are

svn update	 (updates your directory with the most recent version)
svn commit	 (executes above add command and commits local changes)
svn add file     (queue new file to add to repository)
svn diff         (identifies changes in your local directory)
svn diff -r HEAD (identifies differences between your directory and repository)
svn revert file	 (revert to repository version of file)

3. To recover an old svn snapshot of the asymptote directory do

mkdir old
cd old
svn co https://asymptote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/asymptote/trunk/asymptote
cd asymptote
svn update -r "{2006-05-21 23:55}"
OR
svn update -r "{2006-05-21}"
OR
svn update -r 1234

For further examples of revision specifications, see:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.tour.revs.html#svn.tour.revs.keywords

4. These commands are useful for examining revision history:

svn log
svn annotate file.cc
svn diff -r 1000:1001
svn diff -r "{2006-05-16 19:11}":"{2005-05-21 19:13}" 

Say man svn for more info.

5. Merge:

wget http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svnmerge/svnmerge.py -O /usr/local/bin/svnmerge
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/svnmerge

Initialize branch directory:

svnmerge init
svn ci -F svnmerge-commit-message.txt

Basic commands:

svnmerge avail               # show only the revision numbers
svnmerge avail --log         # show logs of the revisions
svnmerge avail --diff        # show diffs of the revisions

svn commit
svnmerge merge
svn update
svn commit -F svnmerge-commit-message.txt

6. Symbolic links can point to a local mirror of an external directory:

svn propset svn:externals "tex svn+ssh://vortex.math.ualberta.ca/svn/tex" .
or
svn propedit svn:externals .
svn propget svn:externals .
